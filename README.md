# AI-ML-Projects
This repository contains Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects. All the projects are tested to run on windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.
It consists of all the major algorithms implementation and trained models that form the basis of AI/ML.

For example:

linear regression (Regression with single variable)

multiple regression (Regression with multiple variables) 

logistic regression (Simple and regularized)

neural networks (Supervised and Unsupervised)

clustering (Not Implemented Yet) and other artificial intelligence topics like 

Breadth first search

Depth first search

Greedy Approach

A* Algorithm

Minimax

Expectimax and other strategies

Bayes Naive

Sentiment Analysis

Requirements include Jupyter Notebook and Python.
